**account/model.py**
The purpose of the two functions profile_path and cover_image_path in your models.py file is to generate unique file paths for storing user profile and cover images, respectively. These functions ensure that each uploaded image is saved in a unique location, preventing filename collisions and organizing files in a structured manner.


Purpose: Generates a unique file path for storing user profile images.
Parameters:
user: The user object, representing the user who is uploading the image.
filename: The original filename of the uploaded image.
Process:
extension = filename.split(".").pop(): Extracts the file extension from the original filename.
directory_name = f"{user.username}_{user.id}": Creates a directory name using the user's username and user ID to ensure that each user's images are stored in a separate directory.
hash = hashlib.md5(str(time.time()).encode()).hexdigest(): Generates a unique hash based on the current time to ensure the filename is unique.
return f"images/profile/{directory_name}/{hash}.{extension}": Constructs and returns the full file path for the profile image.
